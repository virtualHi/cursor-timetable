I want to create a web application for my team to manage our duty roster and clock-in/clock-out records. It is a small scale application for 30 people so keep it simple and low cost. 
There will be three roles in the application: staff, team leader and service supervisor.
Everyone can input their duty roster in the system, including the working time, location, and tasks for the next week. Staff will submit their roster to the team leader or service supervisor for approval, team leaders will submit to the service supervisor, and the service supervisor does not require approval. Everyone can update their roster, but updates will need to be submitted for approval again.
The system will provide a dashboard in Gannt style to display everyone's duty roster for the current week just like the schedule view of Microsoft outlook software. You may refer to the attached screen shot. 
Another feature is that everyone should clock in when they start work and clock out when they leave work. If staff forget to clock in or out, they can date back log their records, but these records will be marked as date-back. The system should check if the clock-in/clock-out records match the roster and remind staff to retroactively log their records.
I want to start with the UI of the dashboard first. Please make a prototype of the dashboard for me to comment and further edit. We will not start making functions and backend until the UI is confirmed.
